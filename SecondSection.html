                    <p>Me: Hello! Let’s discuss the details of the website you requested. Why do you need it?

                        Client: Hello! I would like learn a bit more about frontend and backend, CDN architecture and history of HTML, CSS, and I would like to have it visualized on a website.

                        Me: Okay, what else do you want to have?

                        Client: Maybe a section which says that I am the end user and that I am the client. You can also include the interview we have now but please make it on a separate section.  

                        Me: Okay. So basically you want to have 5 drop down menus where information is presented in the following sequence: Frontend vs Backend, CDN architecture, History of HTML and CSS and the end user and the client, is that correct?

                        Client: Yes, but not precisely. Can you include the drop down menu of the end user and the client between Front end vs Backend and CDN architecture. 

                        Me: Of course. And what colors would you like? 

                        Client: So I would like to have the title “Useful info” on the top, in grey. Then the button which directs to the second section. And then under that I would like to have the 5 drop down menus with information, as a column, under each other. The buttons can be blue with white font color and when the information unfolds would be great if it is white with black font color.

                        Me: And the background?

                        Client: Make it light green please. 

                        Me: Okay. So far, so good. And what would you like to have in the second section?

                        Client: I want two drop down menus, the same colors but this time let them be located next to each other. On the first one upload the picture of crazy 8s, and on the second one include the interview we are having now, as a reference point.
                        
                        Me: It is clear. Something else?

                        Client: No, that’s it. Thank you. 

                        Me: Thank you too. I am going to reach out soon so tell me if you like how it is going or not. 

                        Client: Perfect.
